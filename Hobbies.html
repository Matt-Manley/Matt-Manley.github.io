<h1> Hobbies/Quick Bio </h1>

<p> I am a young professional looking to find my passion in a society saturated with complacency. I have no desire to limit myself to a status quo and I am always looking for something new and interesting.
When I am not working I enjoy the ever-changing environment of PC gaming and I love basketball, motocross, and either playing or listening to music. Admittedly I do PC gaming and listen to music more than the other activities due to both Covid-19 and the convienence of just opening a game on the computer
rather than organizing a game of basketball or spending money to ride at a motocross track.  I have recently developed a strong interest in computer software rather than the route of business management which was the intended track for my career during my time at college.
My interest in Computer Science was sparked by an already preexisting interest in technology as a whole and was refined into the area of Computer Software after attempting to modify some game-files within some of my PC games as well as having to come up with app ideas(either for Android or Apple OS) for a business class.
After that activity in class I started thinking "After coming up with these cool ideas for apps, why not try and make them a reality?" and that started my journey into the world of coding. Subsequently, even though my education points me in the direction of managing a business I have decided to pursue my passion for
technology and coding even though I'm starting from behind and will have to put in that much more work.
